# mipt-numerics
Code for random-matrix and 1D numerical analysis performed in *Khindanov et al.*, [Observable Measurement-Induced Transitions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09353).
The code for the 2D numerics included in this repository was not utilized in the paper. Instead, the 2D numerics in the paper were performed using a different code.
